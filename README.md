# RSA1024
This implementation of RSA is on an FPGA platform to test the performance of the algorithm in terms of latency as a comparison to AES

The C++ implementation uses the arbitrary precision library and the header file "ap_int.h" and care has to be taken when cross compiling on other platforms
